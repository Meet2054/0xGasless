# Agent Actions

### By default, AgentKit supports the following tools:

- `get_balance` - Get balance for specific assets
- `trade` - Trade assets (mainnets only)
- `transfer` - Transfer assets between addresses

Any action not supported by default by AgentKit can be added by adding agent capabilities.
